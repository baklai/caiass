## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baklai/caiass.git
cd caiass
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file in the project root:

```bash
API_ID=`your_telegram_api_id`
API_HASH=`your_telegram_api_hash`
GPT_MODEL=`your_ollama_model`
```

API_ID and API_HASH can be obtained from https://my.telegram.org

Start the bot:

```bash
npm start
```

Or in development mode (with file watching):

```bash

On first run, if users.ini is empty, the bot will prompt you to select which users are allowed to interact with the AI assistant.

The bot will maintain a per-user chat history and respond only to messages from allowed users.
